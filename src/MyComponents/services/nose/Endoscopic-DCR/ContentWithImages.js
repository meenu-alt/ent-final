          <h2>What is Endoscopic DCR?</h2>
          <p>Endoscopic Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a surgical procedure performed to create a new tear drainage pathway between the lacrimal sac and the nasal cavity. This is typically done to treat tear duct obstruction causing excessive tearing (epiphora) or recurrent infections (dacryocystitis). The procedure involves opening the drainage passage for the tear between the eye and the nose. This will be done endoscopically using straight and angled endoscopes. Powered instruments like Microdebrider or Drill may be used for tissue removal or to make openings. A stent may be left inside for a variable period of time to ensure patency of the passage. Subsequent to the procedure repeat visits plus examination and syringing by the eye specialist may be required. </p>
          <p>The nose may be packed for a day or two days following the surgery. </p>
         
          <p>
          Post op visits as informed from time to time will be required as informed to the patient from time to time.
