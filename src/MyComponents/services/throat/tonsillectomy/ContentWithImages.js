                <p>A tonsillectomy is the surgical removal of the tonsils. The tonsils are two small almond-shaped mounds of lymphatic tissue in the back of the throat. They are part of your body's immune system to fight infection and are only important during the first few years of life.</p>
                <p>This surgery is normally performed under General anaesthesia and usually requires one day of stay in hospital. But in some cases it can be done on day care basis.</p>

              <p>Usually recurrent episodes of tonsillitis follow which require course of antibiotics and pain killers. Sometimes even pus can accumulate in tonsils and nearby structures of throat which may cause difficulty in swallowing and in rare case difficulty in breathing. This can be life threatening.</p>
              <p>Peritonsillitis/ Peritonsillar abscess can occur. In children recurrent strep throat may predispose to Rheumatic Fever. Enlarged Tonsils cause snoring and disturbed sleep on account of Sleep Apnoea. This is a dangerous condition in children as well as adults.</p>
