                <h2 className="pq-section-title">What is Adenoidectomy?</h2>
                <p>
                  Adenoidectomy is a surgical procedure performed to remove enlarged adenoid tissue, which is a mass of lymphoid tissue located behind the nose in the nasopharynx. This surgery is often recommended to address issues such as nasal obstruction, recurrent ear infections, and sleep-disordered breathing in children.
                </p>
                <h2 className="pq-section-subtitle sub-subtitle">Indications for Adenoidectomy</h2>
                <p>
                  Adenoidectomy is typically recommended for children with enlarged adenoids causing nasal obstruction, sleep disturbances, recurrent middle ear infections, or impaired hearing. It may also be performed as part of a combined procedure, such as myringotomy with grommet insertion.

                <p>
                  Adenoidectomy is performed through the mouth, with no external incisions. The ENT surgeon uses a mouth gag and tongue depressor to access the nasopharynx. The adenoid tissue is removed either under direct vision or using angled endoscopes. The procedure typically takes 30 to 60 minutes, depending on the method used.
                </p>
                <h2 className="pq-section-subtitle sub-subtitle">Post-Surgery Care</h2>
                <p>
                  After the surgery, the child is monitored in a recovery room until fully awake. Post-operative care includes proper nutrition, avoiding spicy or hard foods, and following prescribed medications. Regular follow-up visits with the surgeon are essential to ensure proper healing.

            Adenoidectomy with Tube Insertion
          </h2>
          <div className="content">
            <p>
              Adenoids are soft tissues behind the nose that help fight infections. However, when enlarged, they can cause fluid buildup behind the eardrums, leading to pain and hearing loss. During ear tube insertion, a tiny tube is placed in the eardrum to drain fluid and allow air into the middle ear.
            </p>
            <p>
              This procedure is common in children who experience recurrent ear infections, fluid buildup for more than three months, or abnormal ear or mouth structures. By the time the tubes fall out, the natural passageway from the middle ear to the back of the nose often functions better.

                  While adenoidectomy is generally safe, potential complications include bleeding, infection, nasal regurgitation, and changes in voice. These risks are minimal and can be managed with proper post-operative care.
