              Perforation of the eardrum can occur due to trauma or infection.
              Middle ear infection (Otitis Media) often leads to a perforated
              eardrum.
            </p>
            <p>
              A perforated eardrum causes hearing loss and allows infections to
              travel from the external ear to the middle ear.
            </p>
            <p>
              Frequent colds and water entering the ear are common causes of ear
              discharge. Every time discharge occurs, bacterial toxins can enter
              the inner ear, leading to **sensorineural hearing loss**, which is
              permanent.
            </p>
            <p>
              A persistent eardrum perforation must be repaired surgically
              through **Myringoplasty** (Myringo - eardrum, Plasty - repair).
            </p>
            <p>
              Myringoplasty is a surgical procedure to repair a hole in the
              eardrum (tympanic membrane). It helps restore hearing, prevent
              infections, and improve ear health.
            </p>
            <p>
              The surgery is typically performed under **local or general
              anesthesia**, using a small graft to close the perforation.
              Recovery is usually quick, with minimal discomfort.
