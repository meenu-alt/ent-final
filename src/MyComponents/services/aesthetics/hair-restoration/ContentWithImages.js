          <h2>What is Hair Restoration?</h2>
          <p>
            Hair restoration refers to medical and surgical treatments designed
            to combat hair loss and promote regrowth. At our center, we use
            advanced techniques to analyze scalp health and customize treatment
            plans for optimal results.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Hair Restoration Services</h2>
          <p>
            We offer a range of cutting-edge treatments to address different
            types of hair loss. Our approach ensures that patients receive
            effective and scientifically backed solutions for healthier, fuller
            hair.
          </p>

          <h2>PRP Therapy</h2>
          <p>
            Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy involves using the patientâ€™s own
            plasma to stimulate hair growth. This minimally invasive procedure
            enhances follicle health and promotes natural hair regeneration.
          </p>

          <h2>Hair Transplantation</h2>
          <p>
            Our clinic specializes in advanced hair transplantation techniques,
            including Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) and Follicular Unit
            Transplantation (FUT), to restore hair density effectively.
          </p>

          <h2>Mesotherapy</h2>
          <p>
            Mesotherapy is a non-surgical treatment that delivers essential
            nutrients directly to the scalp, improving hair strength and growth.
            This therapy enhances scalp circulation and revitalizes hair
            follicles.
