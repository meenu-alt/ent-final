         <p>
           Classically <strong>Adenoidectomy</strong> is performed through an open mouth (there is no mark, cut, or incision outside or on the skin anywhere – it is all done through the Nose and Throat).
         </p>
         <p>
           The ENT surgeon will use a mouth gag and tongue depressor to open the mouth of the child. The soft palate is then retracted by soft tubes inserted through each nostril and brought out from the mouth. This opens up the Nasopharynx – the region behind the nose where the Adenoids reside. Either under direct vision or using angled Endoscopes, the Adenoid tissue is removed bit by bit until none is left.
         </p>
         <p>
           The entire procedure takes about half to one hour, depending upon the method used.

            Adenoid Surgery with Tube Insertion
          </h2>
          <p>
            Adenoids are soft tissue behind the nose that helps your child fight infection.
            As a result, fluid can build up behind the eardrums, causing pain and hearing loss.
            During ear tube insertion, a tiny tube is placed into the eardrum to allow fluid to drain
            and let air enter the middle ear. This procedure is very common in children.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your child may need an ear tube insertion if they:
          </p>
          <ol className="doted-list">
            <li>Has had fluid in the ears for 3 or more months</li>
            <li>Has had a long-running ear infection</li>
            <li>Gets ear infections often</li>
            <li>Has an abnormal shape to his or her ears or mouth</li>
            <li>Has had certain ear injuries</li>

                <b>Complications of Anaesthesia –</b> though safe there may be some complications related to the use of Anaesthetic agents and General Anaesthesia – these are best discussed with the Anaesthetist before the surgery. They may include drug related side effects, sedation, requirement for prolonged intubation or more.
                </p>
                <div><p><b>Complications of the surgery</b></p>
                <ol className="key-points">
                  <li>
                  Bleeding – though there is minimal bleeding during an Adenoidectomy sometimes there may be excessive intra operative or post operative period. There may be bleeding 7-10 days after the procedure – this is known as secondary haemorrhage and is usually controlled with antibiotics.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  Infection – may happen in the post operative period though a routine prophylactic is prescribed for about 48 hours post surgery.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  Nasal Regurgitation- if excessive tissue is removed – this usually recovers spontaneously over a period of time.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                  Change of Voice – because bulky tissue is removed the voice may change (usually becomes clearer) after the surgery. If the patient is a child artist as singer you must discuss this with the surgeon and speech therapist because the voice after the surgery may be different.
